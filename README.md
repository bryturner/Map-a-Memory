## More About the Project
I built this very basic project in order to learn how to use third-party APIs, JS classes, and local storage features. This was one of the first projects I built using JavaScript. Besides learning more about JavaScript, my goal was to practice using CSS to create a polished user interface. 

## Improvements and Future Features
- User accounts to save memories in a database
- Multiple users can add memories to an event
- Edit/delete a specific event (no reset all button)
- Responsive design
